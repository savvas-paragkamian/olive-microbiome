# Olive microbiome

The Sarris Lab and collaborators from ELGO Dimitra, 
conducted research on the microbial communities living inside the roots of Koroneiki olive trees.
The aim of this study is to understand how these microbes interact with the tree and the environment.

## Sampling and Data Collection

To study these microbes, researchers collected root samples from olive trees across different locations in Crete. They worked closely with ELGO-DIMITRA, an agricultural research institute, to choose representative olive groves and gather high-quality samples.

Five major sampling trips were carried out:
	1.	Spring (March 2019) – Root samples were taken from five olive trees, with careful collection from different parts of the root system.
	2.	Summer (July 2019) – The number of samples per tree was reduced based on preliminary findings to optimize research costs and efficiency.
	3.	Autumn (October 2019) – Samples were collected again from the same trees to track seasonal changes.
	4.	Additional Autumn Sampling (October 2019) – A separate set of samples was collected from trees in the Viannos region to compare microbiomes from different environments.
	5.	Final Sampling (February 2020) – Samples were collected from the Monumental Olive Tree in Azoria, Ierapetra, a historic tree, to study its unique microbiome.

During each sampling, researchers also gathered soil samples, which were sent to a specialized laboratory to analyze soil quality and characteristics.

## Microbial Isolation and DNA Analysis

After collecting the root samples, scientists carefully removed soil and contaminants before isolating the microbial DNA. This allowed them to analyze the endophytic microbiome (microbes living inside the plant’s roots, not just in the surrounding soil).

A total of 250 different microbial strains were isolated and stored in a bio-bank for future research. DNA sequencing identified the types of bacteria present, revealing that:
	•	88% belonged to the Firmicutes group, including Bacillus and Paenibacillus species.
	•	9% were Proteobacteria, including Burkholderia and Pseudomonas.
	•	A small percentage were Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes.

To ensure accurate DNA analysis, researchers developed new primer sets that helped eliminate interference from the olive tree’s own DNA. This improved the accuracy of microbial identification.

## Main findings

The study revealed that:
	•	Different olive tree locations had distinct microbial communities, influenced by soil composition, tree age, and farming practices.
	•	Trees in the ELGO agro-garden had similar microbiomes, while those from Viannos and Azoria showed noticeable differences.
	•	Seasonal changes affected the microbial composition, though further analysis is needed to fully understand these shifts.

The microbial data was analyzed using bioinformatics tools, comparing microbial diversity across samples.
A database (https://olive-microbiome.com/) was created to store and share results.

This research provides valuable insights into the microbial life within olive roots, which could have implications for tree health, soil management, and sustainable agriculture. The data will help scientists understand how microbes interact with olive trees and could lead to better farming practices and improved tree resilience.
